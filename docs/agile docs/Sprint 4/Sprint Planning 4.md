# Capacity - 2 Weeks Sprint

- **Tim (8 hours first week outside of class, 6-7 hours second week outside of class; total: 14-15 hours outside of class)**: I am trying to limit my workload to a reasonable amount, according to college standards, to prevent burnout. I will be less busy the first week and more busy the second week due to a paper outline I must submit on 4/25.
    - I am most available on:
        - Wednesday (12-2 pm, after 4 pm)
        - Thursday (any time outside of class)
        - Friday (any time outside of class)
- **Alyssa (15 hours each week):** For the first and second week of the sprint I can meet after 6:30 pm M, T, W, and TH. 1st week I can also meet 4-5 pm on F.  Can also meet in mornings before 11 am M, W, and F and before 11:30 am on T and TH. I am not entirely sure on my weekend schedule yet(depending on tennis), but I will most likely have a good amount of time to work on this weekend and should be pretty free on Saturday and Sunday.
- **Nifemi: (15 hours every week):** I’m usually free after 4pm, but I have 2 other projects that I’m working on, so my availability is on a day-by-day basis. But I’m able to meet immediately after our class time.
- **Khanh (16 hours 1st week, 10 hors 2nd week):** I’m available and willing to put in a lot of hours on our project work. I can meet on most days after 4pm and all morning on Friday, most of Saturday and Sunday. **I will not be in class on Wednesday 4/23.** I have a math midterm the second week so will not be working too much on this project.
