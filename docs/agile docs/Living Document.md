# **1. Product Description with User Roles**

## Overview

Our app is called StressLess. The primary purpose of the app is to help users manage their time more easily and to create a customized schedule best accustomed to the user’s needs. The inspiration for the name is from the goal for users to feel less stressed with time management and create a schedule for individual users to best complete work and reduce stress. 

## **How It Works**

The first time the app is used, the user will fill out a survey that asks them about their preferences. The following preferences in the survey would be: time of day user prefers to study, sleep schedule, how they prefer to split up their studying time– if they prefer to study in chunks where they study for a little and take a break or if they prefer to get everything done in one sitting. 

After the user fills out the initial questionnaire, they will also be able to input their class schedule and other time commitments for a certain date range. After we are able to generate information on the person, then the app will be able to generate a customizable schedule. 

## **User Roles**

The primary user roles are students. It will mainly target middle school students, high school students, college students, grad school students, PhD students, or any student with a syllabus (i.e. structured deliverables and deadlines). 

Students will input the upcoming work and activities to the app and then the app will create the schedule. Students will then use the calendar to keep track of their time.

Even though this app is primarily designed for students, it could also be adapted to other audiences such as adults with a full-time job, parents with commitments to take care of their children with household duties and bring them to various activities, and any other people who have busy schedules and need help managing their time. 

## Why this App is Useful

This app helps fulfill the students' needs of time management because it helps students organize their time and keep track of specific tasks that they need to accomplish, as well as customizing their schedules to include personalized study and break times. The target users for this product are mainly college students. This app will be better than the already existing journals and calendars because it will create a personalized calendar based on questionnaires rather than the user manually inputting when they believe they will complete each individual assignment.

## Challenges

One challenge of our product is if the user either underestimates or overestimates the time they believe a specific assignment will take. Realistically, if a student incorrectly estimates how long certain assignments will take, the app will potentially miscalculate it and if it underestimates how long certain assignments will take, this means that the schedule won’t be accurate anymore because it needs more time for the assignment compared to its initial input. Therefore, users should be able to edit their time commitments in the app, so it can generate a new schedule.

Another challenge will be the personalization of the schedules. Because there are so many different options that users could enter, the app might get confused and miscalculate certain schedules. Being able to create an algorithm that works for all different types of users and preferences is challenging because of the infinite amount of options and possibilities. A possible solution would be to give the user multiple options for a customized schedule.

## Comparison to Previous Apps

This idea is different from previous scheduling and time management apps like Google Calendar,  focus apps like Pomofocus, and task management apps like Todoist because it creates automatic customizable schedules based on preferences rather than having schedules manually inputted in (Google, 2025; Cirillo, 2019; Salihefendić 2007). Google Calendar has users manually input their schedule of which tasks they will accomplish and when, Pomofocus lets the user manually choose how much time at a time they want to focus on homework in general, and Todoist is a checklist of tasks that the user must complete at certain times. 

Our app is different because it automatically creates a schedule to complete tasks based on each user’s personal preferences. Instead of creating a generic schedule for everyone, it is customizable because different people favor certain times and block time differently to do their work.

# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. User authorization is used to provide online sync/backup functionality as well as protecting unauthorized users from viewing schedules. The application should be usable offline.
2. The app can support multiple users at the same time with minimal latency.
3. When events are planned, they appear on the screen right away with no long lag or delay between planning and looking at the new events.
4. The calendar should be able to handle more than 1,500 planned events per user.

# 4. External Requirements

1. The product must handle invalid user input (like time overlaps, absurd amounts of events, etc.) gracefully during the initial survey step and syllabus scanning step (if implemented).
    1. Nudge users to not overschedule themselves, but users may proceed anyways.
2. If the product can be used offline, its offline functionalities need to be robust. For example, all features involving viewing the calendar, managing events, generating routines, and notifications are available. User authorization for syncing will not be available.
3. This idea will be implemented as a web app using React for the frontend framework, NodeJS and Express for the backend, and TypeScript for the language across both ends.
4. We will make sure to thoroughly document the build process. We will also document server setup instructions for any online functionality, such as authentication or backups.
5. Our MVP’s scope is appropriate for the semester, since we have several components to implement, including handling user input, making a scheduler algorithm, and designing an appropriate calendar interface.

**Data Models: Diagram** [https://dbdiagram.io/d/StressLess-67cb5f29263d6cf9a0a32612](https://dbdiagram.io/d/StressLess-67cb5f29263d6cf9a0a32612)

![StressLessDB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4084ee8d-2f37-490d-8dfd-41ea1dfae0e5)

## 5.2 Software Architecture

### a) Major software components and their functionality at a conceptual level.

Our system consists of several key software components that interact to provide a seamless experience for users in managing their schedules efficiently. Below is a conceptual breakdown of each major component and its role within the system.

1. **User Interface (Frontend)**
    - Provides a responsive and intuitive UI for users to interact with the system.
    - Allows users to enter preferences, create events and deadlines, and view their generated study schedules.
    - Displays notifications and reminders about upcoming deadlines and study sessions.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Manages user registration and login using third party service.
    - Supports authentication methods like email/password login
    - Ensures secure session handling and prevents unauthorized access to user data.
3. **User Preferences Module**
    - Collects user input on study habits, break preferences, and schedule constraints.
    - Stores and updates user preferences dynamically to refine scheduling logic.
4. **Event & Deadline Management**
    - Allows users to add events (e.g., classes, meetings) and deadlines (e.g., assignments, exams).
    - Supports **recurring events** with configurable patterns (e.g., daily, weekly).
    - Tracks estimated time needed to complete each task before its deadline.
    - Stores user-defined and system-generated events (e.g., study blocks).
5. **Backend with Business Logic**
    - Core logic that **dynamically generates personalized study schedules** based on user preferences, events, and deadlines.
    - Uses algorithms to:
        - Allocate study blocks efficiently.
        - Prioritize deadlines based on urgency and estimated effort.
        - Ensure optimal work-break balance according to user habits.
    - Recalculates and adjusts schedules in response to new inputs (e.g., updated deadlines, changed availability).
6. **Database**
    - Stores **all user data**, including profiles, preferences, events, and deadlines.
    - Ensures **data integrity** through relational constraints and indexing.
    - Supports querying for efficient retrieval of scheduling-related information.

### b) Interfaces between components at a high level.

- **Frontend ↔ Backend (API Layer)**
    - The frontend communicates with the backend via **RESTful API endpoints** (e.g., `/api/preferences`, `/api/events`, `/api/generate_schedule`).
- **Backend ↔ Database**
    - The backend fetches and updates user data using SQL queries.
- **Authentication ↔ Third Party Service**
    - The frontend authenticates users via third party service and passes authentication tokens to the backend for access control.
- **Backend ↔ Scheduling Logic**
    - The backend triggers the scheduling engine, which processes user inputs and generates personalized study plans.

### c) Major data storage components and interfaces between data storage and software components.

| **Component** | **Data Source** | **Interaction Method** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Backend | API Calls |
| Backend | Database | SQL Queries |
| Authentication | Users Table | Token |
| Scheduling Engine (Business Logic) | Preferences, Events, Deadlines | Queries User Data, Generates Study Plan |
| Event Management | Events Table | CRUD Operations via API |
| Deadline Tracking | Deadlines Table | Queries and Updates Task Completion |

### d) Diagram of StressLess system's architecture.

![StressLess Demo.png](Living%20Document%200cfda53982fb40e0bb52a6b3a1228e37/StressLess_Demo.png)

### e) Assumptions underpinning our chosen architecture

- Users input accurate information about their preferences and availability.
- Events and deadlines are regularly updated by users for schedule accuracy.
- The scheduling logic is rule-based initially, with potential for AI-powered optimization in later versions.
- The system is scalable to support future enhancements (e.g., AI-based time management, collaboration features).

## 5.4 Documentation Plan

### User guide

A user guide document will be available in the repository that describes how the end-user can use the application. The guide will be detailed, describing expected behaviors of the application.

### Help menu

The application will contain a help menu that either shows a simplified or full version of the user guide. Therefore, the user can get help inside the app.

### Developer guide

The repository will be bundled with a developer guide which contains information about how to build the app in a single step, as well as how to deploy the app on a server.

### Code documentation

As usual, the code will be documented as well.

# 6. Scope and Feature List

## 4+ major features you will implement. The major features should constitute a minimal viable product (MVP).

- Users can input activities (both recurring and one-time) they must do, including class time, assignments, extracurricular activities (including clubs, sports, etc.), work hours, meal times, and sleep times. Users can also input expected times needed to complete each activity that does not occur at fixed times.
- Users will fill out initial survey, so they can input preferences for when they are the most productive, when they want to have free time, when they want to sleep/wake up, and if they prefer working through their assignments for long periods of time or if they need small breaks in between.
- The app designs a weekly routine for a whole academic semester that caters to the user’s commitments as well as focus/productive time preference in a time-blocking manner.
- Users can update their planned activities and make the app regenerate the calendar.
- Notifications for upcoming deadlines, important events, etc.
- User will be able to see weekly and daily schedules as well as monthly schedule
- The app will have an authentication system. Users must log in and out to access the app.

## 2+ stretch goals you hope to implement.

- Scanning a syllabi/multiple different versions of syllabi
- Users can export the generated calendars to calendar apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.
- Checklist of assignments to check off when they’re completed
- Be able to print out schedule by saving it as a PDF
- Change UI colors for scheduled items to accommodate colorblind users.

## 2+ features that are out of scope that you will not implement.

- A way to share the calendar with other people in the app
- A community for users to share their routines and advices

### **Postconditions**

Once the use case is complete, Bob will have a schedule to help him manage his long project over a period of time.

### **Flow:**

1. Bob will open the web app and a survey will open
2. The survey will ask Bob the following questions: rank times of day he feels most productive (morning, afternoon, night), which days he is willing to work on, how often he prefers to take breaks during work, how many total hours he wants to work in a day, what periods of time of the day he is willing to work, and what time Bob wants to sleep/wake up at, and about upcoming projects he wants to work on.

Bob will fill out the survey including and some of the following he will enter is the period of time he prefers to work is 9 am - 3 pm, he prefers to take breaks every 2 hours, he prefers 10 minute breaks, and he wants a recurring lunch break from 12:00-12:30 on weekdays, and the days he prefers to work is M-F, and he will input h
4. The survey will then take him to a Home Screen displaying a calendar which will currently display an empty calendar with an add or delete button in the corner
5. Later that day Bob is assigned his multi-month project to work on for Google. Bob clicks the add button and labels the event as New Google App. He inputs that he believes it will take about 450 hours to complete. He has 3 months to do this project. The current date is Feb 20, so he inputs May 20 as the due date for the project 
6. The algorithm will recognize that he will want to work about 150 hours per month and approximately 5 hours per day if he is working over 5 days to complete this project in a reasonable time frame56
7. The calendar will then re-calculate and create a schedule of when he should be working on his project based on his preferences from the survey and visually display it on the calendar on the app.
8. A possible outcome the calendar might display is an option that the calendar may display for M T W TH F over the next 3 months is  9-11 am: work on project, 11-11:10 am: break, 11:10-12:00 work on project, 12:00 -12:30: lunch, 12:30-2:30: work on project, 2:30-2:40: break, 2:40 - 3:00 work on project, 3:00 pm: stop work for the day

### **Alternative Flow:**

1. Bob takes the initial personal preferences survey in the app
2. Bob took the personal preferences survey, but realizes that he wants to sleep in and start at 10 am instead of 9 am
3. He clicks an edit personal preferences survey app within the app to change his work preference to 10 instead of 9 
4. Bob also realizes that this project is a lot more difficult than he thought it was going to be and he underestimated the time that it was actually going to take 
5. He clicks on the assignment to add 10 more hours, so now it says it will take 460 hours instead of 450
6. The schedule will recalculate and display based on the updated user preferences
