5. Wrap up work on your product and make it presentable to future audiences.

# Capacity - 2.5 Week Sprint

- **Tim (7 hours each week outside of class; 4-6 hours on Monday-Wednesday of finals week):** I have several large assignments and exams due the second week (by Wednesday) so I will be more flexible the first week and after Wednesday of the second week. However, I also have a lot of meetings the first week partially due to CA busywork that didn’t exist last year. I only have one exam during finals week so I may have more time during the three days of this week to complete any remaining tasks. My preferred meeting times are Wednesdays after 4 pm, any time on Thursdays except 11 am-12 pm and 2-4 pm, and any time on Fridays except 2-4 pm.
- **Alyssa (15 hours each week):** I do have a good amount of work in other classes as well to do close to the end of the semester, but I will still try and put in a good amount of work for this sprint. I can meet after 6:30 pm M, T, W, and TH. 1st week I can also meet 4-5 pm on F.  Can also meet in mornings before 11 am M, W, and F and before 11:30 am on T and TH. I am not entirely sure on my weekend schedule yet(depending on tennis), but I will most likely have a good amount of time to work on this weekend and should be pretty free on Saturday and Sunday. I should have a good amount of time during finals week to work on this since I don’t have finals and don’t have exams.
- **Nifemi: (15 hours each week but 8hrs nezt week):** I have two presentations on Tuesday, so I won’t be able to commit much time before that. But after Tuesday, I should be done with two of my class and be able to dedicate more time.
- **Khanh (15 hours each week): I will have a fair amount of time to put in work for this last sprint to ramp up and bring our project close to our MVP. I can meet anytime Friday morning, after 4pm and before 8pm every day.**
- **Madel (10 hours per week):** I’m able to meet most days after 4PM. However, I do have to work on my papers due by exam week, so I won’t be able to work on tasks quickly.
- Exam Week: Monday to Wednesday of exam week will be extremely busy for me since I have two papers and an exam then, so I won’t be able to work on anything then. Thursday to Friday of exam week I am free, and I can work as much as needed then.
- **Cheyanne(10 hours per week):** this sprint will be a bit busier for me with resubmissions in 341 and paper revisions for french. I’m available for pair programming after 4 for the weekdays and after 1 on the weekends

# Goals

Our goal for this last sprint is to complete the MVP:

- **Calendar API Call Integrated:** Although we have defined all endpoints for Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) for events and deadlines, the frontend needs to call these endpoints. Hence, we still have to integrate these calls.
- **Frontend Support for Deadlines:** Performing CRUD operations for deadlines must be implemented in the frontend since the study scheduling algorithm depends on deadlines.
- **Study Scheduling Algorithm**: Finalize and implement the algorithm that automatically schedules study blocks based on user preferences, class times, and deadlines (Backend work). Then make the frontend display the automatically scheduled calendar.
- **Test**: Try to test as many of our logic and integrated components as possible.

We will try to finish the MVP during the first week of the sprint, and the second week will be dedicated to write-ups, bugs fixed, deployment, and preparation for the final demo.
